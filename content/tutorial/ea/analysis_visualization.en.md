## Download data
It is assumed here that you analyze and visualize CrySPY data on your local PC.
If you use CrySPY on a supercomputer or workstation, download the data to your local machine.
You can delete the `work` and `backup` directories if they are not needed, as their file size can be very large.

## Jupyter notebook
Move to the `data/` directory in the results you downloaded earlier.
Then, if the CrySPY utility has already been downloaded locally, copy `cryspy_analyzer_EA.ipynb`.
Alternatively, you can download it directly from GitHub ([CrySPY_utility/notebook/](https://github.com/Tomoki-YAMASHITA/CrySPY_utility/tree/master/notebook)).
Launch Jupyter (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or Jupyter Notebook),
and simply run the cells in order to obtain a figure like the one shown below.
